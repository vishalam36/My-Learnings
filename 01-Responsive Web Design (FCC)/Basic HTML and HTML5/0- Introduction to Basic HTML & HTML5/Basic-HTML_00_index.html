          HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a  <br>
          <ul>
            <li class="big">
                <span>markup language used to describe the structure of a web page</span>.
            </li>
            <li class="big">
                <span>
                    It uses a special syntax or notation to organize and give information
                    about the page to the browser</span>.
            </li>
            <li class="big">
                <span>
                    Elements usually have opening and closing tags that surround and give
                    meaning to content</span>.
            </li>
          </ul>                                                         <br />
    
          For example, there are different tag options to place around text to show whether it is a heading, a paragraph, or a list. <br />
          For example:                                                  <br />
          <img src="./img_01.jpg" alt="element structure code" />       <br />
          Becomes:                                                      <br />
          <img src="./img_02.jpg" alt="element code result" />
        </p>

          The HyperText part of HTML comes from the early days of the web and its
          original use case. Pages usually contained static documents that contained
          references to other documents. These references contained hypertext links
          used by the browser to navigate to the reference document so the user
          could read the reference document without having to manually search for
          it.
          <br />
          As web pages and web applications grow more complex, the W3 Consortium
          updates the HTML specification to ensure that a webpage can be shown
          reliably on any browser. The latest version of HTML is HTML5.
          <br />
          This section introduces how to use HTML elements to give structure and
          meaning to your web content.
